# GenAn_proj_durian
Root repository for my project of draft genome assembly of durian for the course in genome analysis

In the result folder subfolders with results from all diferent programs can be found, these are almost all of them on UPPMAX because of memory limits on github.
The raw data is just a symbolic link to the reaw data for the project
The code folder has the job batch files for all runs made, with names explaining for what program they correspond.

The presentation can be found in the results folder.

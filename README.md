# GenAn_proj_durian
Root repository for my project of draft genome assembly of durian for the course in genome analysis

In the result folder subfolders with results from all diferent programs can be found
The raw data is just a symbolic link to teh reaw data for the project
The code folder has the job batch files for all runs made, it also includes a subfolder with some slurm outputs to keep the code folder tidy. These are deleted when no longer needed
